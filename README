OpenCart_Bitcoin
by John Atkinson (jga) from BTC Gear

This is an OpenCart payment module that communicates with a bitcoin client using JSON RPC.

To install:
upload all files.
install extension in the admin console
input rpc information

This code accurately converts USD to BTC using the up-to-the-minute MtGox average.  It is completely 
self contained and requires no cron jobs or external hardware other than a properly configured 
bitcoind server.  Every order creates a new bitcoin address for payment and gives it a label 
corresponding to the order_id of the order.  It installs like any other OpenCart plugin and it is 
completely integrated with OpenCart.

There are other features that I am working on, but this first version is ready to try out.
