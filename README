OpenCart_Bitcoin
by John Atkinson (jga) from BTC Gear

This is an OpenCart payment module that communicates with a bitcoin client using JSON RPC.

To install:
upload all files.
install extension in the admin console
input rpc information

There are other features that I am working on, but this first version is ready to try out.
